      <h2>brief story</h2>
      <p>
        so 2 months ago i saw people making skins and alot of old skin makers and i was also attracted to this skill,
        my first skin was a mango related skin which wasnt really great but then i improved and made alot of skins which the venge community loves,
        this update christmas 2025 my 3+ skins were added

        update : 

        24 december 2025 10:35 UTC after update NeXi2k [curent developer] suddenly dropped an ss in general chat in which i had verified badge
        after people pinged me i checked it out i was really overjoyed that day! thanks to venge community for alot of support on every skin of mine
